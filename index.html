      <p>This interesting looking lady <span>👆</span>is <a href="https://scientificwomen.net/women/hypatia--47">Hypatia of Alexandria</a> (born c. 350–370; died 415). I decided to research her because she was a remarkable woman practicing science nearly 1,700 years ago. At that time most people involved in science were men, and women were discouraged from becoming educated <span>👎</span>.</p>
      <p class="alexandria-map">
        Hypatia was born in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alexandria,+Alexandria+Governorate,+Egypt/@32.6348242,27.399183,6z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x14f5c49126710fd3:0xb4e0cda629ee6bb9!8m2!3d31.2000924!4d29.9187387">Alexandria, Egypt</a>, which was in the Roman Empire.

      <p>Hypatia was well known for being a philosopher, astronomer, mathematician, and teacher. Students and other teachers came from all over to hear her speak. <span>👩‍🎓</span></p>
      <p>She refused to wear traditional womens clothes and wore scholars robes like the male teachers! You can see her in the robes in this painting by Robert Trewick Bone <span>👇</span></p>

      <p>She studied in The Great Library of Alexandria and she even wrote her own scrolls 📜. Sadly, none of her work has survived until today as it was destroyed when a fire burned down the library <span>🔥🏛🔥😱</span>.</p>
      <p>She got murdered by a Christian mob in 415 AD. Her limbs got dragged to a town called Cinarion and they got burnt <span>😢</span>. Here is a illustration of her death by Louis Figuier <span>👇</span>.</p>
